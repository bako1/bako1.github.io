Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: [Insert Date]_

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles your data and what information is collected while using the app.

### 1. **Information We Collect**
Our app does not collect or store any personal information. The app operates without gathering, storing, or transmitting any data to us or any third parties. However, please note that Google, as the app's platform provider, may collect some data in accordance with its own privacy policy.

### 2. **Use of Location Data**
The app requests access to your device's location to provide two core features:
   - **Qibla Direction**: The app uses your location to determine the direction of the Qibla for prayer.
   - **Prayer Times Calculation**: Your location is used to calculate accurate prayer times based on your geographical position.

Your location data is only used locally within the app and is never stored or transmitted to the developer or any third parties.

### 3. **Exact Alarms and Notifications**
   - **Exact Alarms**: The app uses exact alarms to trigger the Azan (call to prayer) at the correct times.
   - **Notifications**: We send notifications to alert you about upcoming prayer times. These notifications are handled by the device’s internal notification system.

No data related to these alarms or notifications is collected or transmitted.

### 4. **Data Security**
Since our app does not collect or store any personal information, there are no additional data security measures required beyond those provided by the operating system and Google.

### 5. **Third-Party Services**
While we do not collect any personal data, please be aware that Google, as the platform provider, may collect certain information in accordance with its privacy practices. We encourage you to review Google’s privacy policy for more information on what data they may collect.

### 6. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy.

### 7. **Contact Us**
If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at [Insert Contact Information].
